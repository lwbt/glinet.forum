=== UPX compressed build of gum?

* File issue: Create a build for mips? (like for some routers)
* File issue: Consider providing a UPX compressed build of gum?

It will take noticeably longer for `gum` to start (feels like about 500ms), but
for environments where 20 MB are just too much for a small helper tool it might
be worth providing such a build. I see great value in gum's capabilities to
make shell scripts more usable, I wish everyone would be able to see it that
way.

=== Unattended mode for cron job

* Make the script identify if a new release is available
** Make the script identify if the new release is a security fix
*** I have not yet found a simple solution to get a latest release marked as
    security fix. Research so far:
    https://docs.github.com/en/rest/security-advisories/repository-advisories
*** Tailscale recommends turning on automatic updates, to regularly install the
    latest stable release. Lazy updating every few months (to prolong flash
    storage life) is not a parctical option for now. Updates have to be
    installed every few weeks and should be checked daily.

     (https://tailscale.com/security-bulletins#ts-2024-001[example])
**** https://tailscale.com/kb/1196/security-hardening
**** ❌ Consider always checking and ugrading the tailscale version after boot in
     addition to a daily cron job. -- `@reboot` Does not work, see:
     https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/cron#task_specification
**** Configure a cron job that checks every 3 hours against the GitHub API for
     a new version of Tailscale. Beware of GitHub API rate limiting (60/h).
     Favor using an API over scraping a website. Abort the check early (no new
     version, no response, no valid version). Beware of the thundering herd
     problem, retrieve a value for minutes from random.
**** Random minute in the range of 5-55:
     `awk -v min=5 -v max=55 'BEGIN{srand(); print int(min+rand()*(max-min+1))}'`
     https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/140756
**** Other scripts in this repo already manage cron jobs and the pattern looks good
**** Tailscale expects their users to subscribe to security bulletins and check
     their dashboard?
** Compare the versions of `tailscale` and `tailscaled`. If they don't match,
   something has gone wrong and we need to notify the user. This can get tricky
   in unattended mode. (Probably YAGNI and too many concerns on my side, if it
   breaks, the user will find out.)

*** https://forum.openwrt.org/t/how-to-execute-a-bash-shell-command-on-webui-in-openwrt-19-07-6/89427
** Check if the versions of Tailscale binaries match with what we intended to
   install. Tailscale uses semantic versioning, there should be no surprises.
* Allow the script to be run unattended
** `yes | script` is the easiest way, the current behavior of the script should
   be kept
** To keep the output (logs) short upx should be run with `--no-progress` in
   unattended mode
** Need to find a way so that a user needs to pass only a reasonable amount of
   parameters to run the script as an unattended cron job. (Could be done by
   checking the file name the script is run as, works well with bash, not sure
   about dash/ash, but BusyBox utilizes the same trick.)
** Only allow to perform unattended upgrades after one successful manual
   upgrade. Utilize a marker file, like `touch /etc/update-tailscale.successful`.
* Extend capabilites to inform a user about available and required storage
  space
* Develop a pattern for the cron job to keep a few iterations of upgrade logs.
  I have developed a simple rotation in the past (using weekday numbers or day
  of month numbers).

Comment: I'd rather use a systemd timer, but OpenWrt does not use systemd yet.

=== Why packing the executables with UPX?

[NOTE]
====
* https://tailscale.com/kb/1207/small-tailscale
* https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/8613
** Combined: https://github.com/lanrat/openwrt-tailscale-repo/blob/5599153e3c63acad3038a01dbdde0daf233217e0/build.sh#L135
====

Reducing file size by 50% was worth the effort to automate this step.

I found a thread where one user mentioned that he had to use UPX on his router
before finding the thread with the script. After I checked I found that there
is also not much storage space left on my router after intstalling tailscale,
and I doubt that the binaries are getting smaller. Installing such a service on
external storage is not an option for me.

Unlikely. I made the script compress with LZMA. Adding best or brute force will
only make you wait longer at diminishing returns. About 3 minutes is already
long enough.

=== How is the recommended value of 130 MB derived?

I'm not sure myself, here is what I have seen on my travel router:

* 30+15 MB for new binaries on `/overlay` (about 50 MB free, see link:#storage-utilzation[])
* 30+15 MB for old binaries on `/overlay` (with backup)
* 30 for tarball on `/tmp` (about 190 MB free)

**Total:** 115-130 MB
